# Essential web framework
Flask==2.3.3
Flask-CORS==4.0.0
Werkzeug==2.3.7

# Production server (only needed for deployment)
gunicorn==21.2.0

# Core ML (CPU-only to save memory)
torch
torchvision

# Essential numerical computing
numpy

# Image processing (minimal)
Pillow
opencv-python-headless

# Scientific computing (can be replaced with numpy-only implementations)
scipy
scikit-image

# Alternative: If you want to minimize further, you could replace:
# scipy.stats.kurtosis/skew -> numpy or custom implementation
# scipy.spatial.distance.pdist -> numpy-based Euclidean distance
# scikit-image.feature.peak_local_max -> numpy-based peak detection
